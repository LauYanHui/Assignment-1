# Assignment-1

For Assignment 1, I would be making a website of a band by the name of NovelBright
The purpose of this website is pronote the band by showing it's users about it's various music videos and albums.

## Features

Some of the features that the website offers are firstly the about us page which is a page which shows a list of all it's members and their respective social media account when the user click the social media icons it will redirect them to the accounts. The about us page also has a small section that shows the band history. Next would be a the events page where it will showcase the events that are coming users would be able to see the name of the event,the date of the event and the location of the event this part also offers a button which will redirect the user to the main NovelBright  website where more infomation are shown there the website currently is showing 6 events. Next part would be the music website where there are 2 slide show one showing the mainly music videos and the other one showing mainly albums where the one showing music videos is a slideshow that can be clicked to go to it's respective videos on youtube the same is done for the slideshow for the album except the album is done with a timer and every 10seconds the image will change. When clicked it will go to it's respective album on youtube as well. Below that part there are 2 embedded part which are the iframes to NovelBright's Spotify and apple music. I had also added a goods section which will bring the user to another HTML page which will show the goods that the band are selling. Users can also hover the images to see more details of the product such as the product name, product price, and product description and thes user could click the buy now button which will bring the user to the band's merch site. On the footer, I have also added a header and footer which will bring the user to the different part of the pages such as the when clicked the logo will bring the user back to the top of the page if on the main page but if on the shop page it will bring the user back to INDEX.html, Events would bring the user to the Events part in INDEX.html, Music would bring the user to the music part in INDEX.html, Goods will bring the user to Shop.Html.

###Design Process
- As a fan of the band I would want to know each member and their respective social media
- If I stumble accross the website, I would want to know about their popular music and some albums
- I would also want to know some merch they are selling .
- I would also want to be able to receive newsletter if they offer those.
